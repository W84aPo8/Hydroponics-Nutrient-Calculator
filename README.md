# Hydroponics-Nutrient-Calculator
This fertilizer calculator was originally only intended to add up various NPK fertilizers and calculate their total NPK at the elementary level. Since this makes little sense without comparative values, a few standard hydroponic fertilizer recipes were added to give the value a certain significance. Further refinements (Ec value, pH value) were added over time, as it is helpful to have prior knowledge of the expected conductivity (EC) and the pH value. The scope requires a different programming language, but since our customers use a wide variety of operating systems, only HTML and JavaScript remained as common denominators. Unfortunately, I'm not a fan of these "languages".

This means you can always have this "calculator" with you, even without internet. A browser (built from 2000? for very old browsers, an untested alternative is commented out) and this HTML page will suffice.

All data is stored on this page and allows you to easily expand the scope as you wish according to your own needs. If you also want the graphical representation without internet access, download the file Chart.js to your local machine and adjust the path in the script: https://borgmann-aquaponik-hydroponik.ch/chart.js... It is version 2.9.4. You can find them on the Internet here: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/Chart.js/2.9.4/Chart.js - at least that's how it was this morning. Good luck!
